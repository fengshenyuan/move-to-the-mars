# HTTP

- HTTP CODE 401 & 403
    ```
    Status codes 401 (Unauthorized) and 403 (Forbidden) have distinct meanings.

    A 401 response indicates that access to the resource is restricted, and the request did not provide any HTTP authentication. It is possible that a new request for the same resource will succeed if authentication is provided. The response must include an HTTP WWW-Authenticate header to prompt the user-agent to provide credentials.

    A 403 response generally indicates one of two conditions:

    Authentication was provided, but the authenticated user is not permitted to perform the requested operation.
    The operation is forbidden to all users. For example, requests for a directory listing return code 403 when directory listing has been disabled.
